In this project, we present a robust implementation of two-factor authentication using Raspberry Pi, 
leveraging the power of biometric authentication through fingerprint and facial recognition. 
This advanced system introduces an additional layer of security using a MySQL database to
safeguard user accounts against unauthorized access and potential breaches.
The Raspberry Pi serves as the central processing unit, equipped with a camera module
for capturing facial images and a fingerprint sensor module for scanning fingerprints. Through
sophisticated machine learning algorithms, the Raspberry Pi analyzes and stores the biometric
data securely. The system compares the captured facial image with the registered image stored in
the database and authenticates the userâ€™s fingerprint against the registered prints.
By combining both facial and fingerprint identification, the system ensures that access is
granted only when both biometric modalities match, effectively eliminating the vulnerabilities
associated with traditional password-based authentication. This innovative approach not only enhances 
security but also offers a seamless and user-friendly authentication process.
Given the escalating threats in the digital landscape, this cutting-edge technology has significant 
potential for widespread implementation. It can effectively mitigate the risks of unauthorized
access, safeguarding sensitive information and aid overall security measures in various domains,
including personal devices, corporate networks, and sensitive data repositories. With its proven
effectiveness and robustness, this biometric recognition system holds great promise in the ongoing
battle against cybersecurity threats.
